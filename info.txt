FP-Growth options:

-P <attribute index of positive value>
	Set the index of the attribute value to consider as 'positive'
	for binary attributes in normal dense instances. Index 2 is always
	used for sparse instances. (default = 2)
-I <max items>
	The maximum number of items to include in large items sets (and rules). (default = -1, i.e. no limit.)
-N <require number of rules>
	The required number of rules. (default = 10)
-T <0=confidence | 1=lift | 2=leverage | 3=Conviction>
	The metric by which to rank rules. (default = confidence)
-C <minimum metric score of a rule>
	The minimum metric score of a rule. (default = 0.9)
-U <upper bound for minimum support>
	Upper bound for minimum support as a fraction or number of instances. (default = 1.0)
-M <lower bound for minimum support>
	The lower bound for the minimum support as a fraction or number of instances. (default = 0.1)
-D <delta for minimum support>
	The delta by which the minimum support is decreased in
	each iteration as a fraction or number of instances. (default = 0.05)
-S
	Find all rules that meet the lower bound on
	minimum support and the minimum metric constraint.
	Turning this mode on will disable the iterative support reduction
	procedure to find the specified number of rules.
-transactions <comma separated list of attribute names>
	Only consider transactions that contain these items (default = no restriction)
-rules <comma separated list of attribute names>
	Only print rules that contain these items. (default = no restriction)
-use-or
	Use OR instead of AND for must contain list(s). Use in conjunction
	with -transactions and/or -rules
